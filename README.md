# AI_For_Asteroids
Combining AI techniques successfully to play the Asteroids game intelligently, to avoid collisions, gain power-ups, fire projectiles to score points.

## Introduction: - 

The gameplay for Asteroids is well known. The player ship can fire projectiles to destroy asteroids and enemy ships to gain points. The play space wraps around, and the ship can move quickly between the extremes of the play-space. Power-ups appear at random intervals in the play space, which on collision, boosts the ship's fire rate. The game ends when the ship runs out of lives: this happens due to collisions with asteroids.
