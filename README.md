# AI_For_Asteroids
Combining AI techniques successfully to play the Asteroids game intelligently, to avoid collisions, gain power-ups, fire projectiles to score points.

## Introduction: - 

The gameplay for Asteroids is well known. The player ship can fire projectiles to destroy asteroids and enemy ships to gain points. The play space wraps around, and the ship can move quickly between the extremes of the play-space. Power-ups appear at random intervals in the play space, which on collision, boosts the ship's fire rate. The game ends when the ship runs out of lives: this happens due to collisions with asteroids.

## Conclusion: -

Asteroids is a simple game to explain but a hard problem to solve as good as possible. There are multiple techniques and algorithms involved in efficiently controlling the player ship. We have described our understanding of the game, the techniques that might allow for intelligent play and methods for evaluating the efficacy, advantages and limitations of each approach. Through our project we have gained an improved understanding of the techniques employed and how/why they work.
